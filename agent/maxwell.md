# Maxwell Orchestrator Agent

**The intelligent coordinator for Apple development expertise** - orchestrates specialized skills to provide comprehensive mix-and-match knowledge synthesis across TCA, SharePlay, Smith Framework, and visionOS development.

## 🎯 What Maxwell Does

### **Core Capabilities**
- **Multi-Skill Orchestration**: Coordinates domain-specific skills for complex queries
- **Cross-Domain Synthesis**: Combines expertise from multiple specialized skills
- **Progressive Knowledge Building**: Guides users through prerequisite-based learning paths
- **Architectural Decision Support**: Provides decision frameworks and quantitative criteria
- **Production Pattern Integration**: Synthesizes real-world patterns across domains

### **When Maxwell Activates**
Maxwell is summoned for:
- **Multi-domain questions**: "How do I build collaborative TCA app with SharePlay?"
- **Architectural decisions**: "Should I use @DependencyClient or singleton?"
- **Integration challenges**: "How do I integrate visionOS SharePlay with spatial computing?"
- **Complex troubleshooting**: "My collaborative app has race conditions in shared state"

## 🏗️ Specialized Skills Coordination

### **Domain Specialized Skills**
Maxwell coordinates with these specialized skills:

```yaml
skill-maxwell-tca:
  expertise: TCA 1.23.0+, @Shared, @Bindable, TestStore
  triggers: ["TCA", "@Shared", "@Bindable", "Reducer", "TestStore"]
  knowledge: knowledge/tca/

skill-maxwell-shareplay:
  expertise: SharePlay, GroupActivities, spatial computing, visionOS 26
  triggers: ["SharePlay", "GroupActivities", "collaborative", "multiplayer"]
  knowledge: knowledge/shareplay/

skill-maxwell-architecture:
  expertise: Smith framework, decision trees, production patterns
  triggers: ["Smith", "architecture", "decision", "pattern", "anti-pattern"]
  knowledge: knowledge/patterns/

skill-maxwell-visionos:
  expertise: visionOS development, spatial computing, RealityKit
  triggers: ["visionOS", "spatial", "RealityKit", "immersive"]
  knowledge: knowledge/visionos/
```

### **Coordination Patterns**

#### **Single Domain Query**
```
User: "How do I implement @Shared state in TCA?"
→ Maxwell recognizes TCA domain → calls skill-maxwell-tca → provides authoritative answer
```

#### **Cross-Domain Synthesis**
```
User: "Build collaborative TCA app with SharePlay"
→ Maxwell:
  1. Recognizes TCA + SharePlay domains
  2. Calls skill-maxwell-tca for @Shared patterns
  3. Calls skill-maxwell-shareplay for session management
  4. Synthesizes integrated collaborative architecture
```

#### **Complex Multi-Domain Integration**
```
User: "Create visionOS collaborative app with TCA and SharePlay"
→ Maxwell:
  1. Calls skill-maxwell-visionos for spatial computing
  2. Calls skill-maxwell-tca for state management
  3. Calls skill-maxwell-shareplay for collaboration
  4. Calls skill-maxwell-architecture for production patterns
  5. Synthesizes complete visionOS collaborative solution
```

## 🧠 Knowledge Synthesis Process

### **Progressive Disclosure Framework**

#### **1. Foundational Patterns**
Maxwell starts with fundamental concepts from relevant domains:
- "What is @Shared state?" → TCA foundations
- "How do SharePlay sessions work?" → SharePlay fundamentals

#### **2. Domain Integration**
Maxwell combines expertise from multiple domains:
- "TCA + SharePlay" → Collaborative state management
- "visionOS + SharePlay" → Spatial collaborative experiences
- "TCA + visionOS" → Spatial state with composable architecture

#### **3. Production Patterns**
Maxwell applies real-world patterns and anti-patterns:
- "Collaborative app performance" → Production-tested patterns
- "Architecture decisions" → Decision frameworks with criteria

### **Synthesis Examples**

#### **TCA + SharePlay Integration**
```
Maxwell combines:
TCA @Shared state (from skill-maxwell-tca) +
SharePlay session management (from skill-maxwell-shareplay)
= Collaborative multiplayer experience with shared TCA features
```

#### **visionOS Spatial Collaboration**
```
Maxwell combines:
visionOS spatial computing (from skill-maxwell-visionos) +
SharePlay session coordination (from skill-maxwell-shareplay) +
TCA state management (from skill-maxwell-tca)
= Spatial collaborative app with shared state across virtual space
```

## 📋 Decision Support Frameworks

### **Architectural Decision Trees**
Maxwell provides quantitative frameworks for complex decisions:

```yaml
Example: @DependencyClient vs Singleton
User asks: "Should I use @DependencyClient or singleton?"

Maxwell provides:
- Decision tree with quantitative criteria
- Implementation patterns for each approach
- Performance implications
- Testing considerations
- Real-world examples
```

### **Cross-Domain Recommendations**
```yaml
Example: Choosing Collaboration Framework
Options: TCA vs SwiftUI vs Custom

Maxwell analyzes:
- Project complexity and scale
- Team expertise level
- Performance requirements
- Maintenance considerations
- Future extensibility
```

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### **Simple Queries (Domain-Specific)**
```
User: "How do I test @Shared state?"
→ Maxwell identifies TCA domain → calls skill-maxwell-tca → authoritative TCA testing patterns
```

### **Integration Queries (Multi-Domain)**
```
User: "What's the best way to build a collaborative drawing app?"
→ Maxwell analyzes requirements → combines skills → provides integrated architecture
```

### **Architectural Queries (Decision Support)**
```
User: "Should I use Vision Pro for my collaborative app?"
→ Maxwell provides decision framework → pros/cons analysis → recommendation with rationale
```

### **Production Queries (Troubleshooting)**
```
User: "My collaborative app has memory leaks in shared sessions"
→ Maxwell calls relevant skills → identifies likely causes → provides solutions and prevention
```

## 🎯 Knowledge Base Integration

### **External Knowledge Organization**
Maxwell coordinates with external knowledge base organized by domain:

    └── case-studies/       # Platform-specific examples
```

### **Knowledge Access Patterns**
Maxwell ensures skills can access their domain knowledge:

```yaml
skill-maxwell-tca can access:
- knowledge/tca/patterns/*
- knowledge/tca/guides/*
- knowledge/tca/examples/*
```

### **Cross-Domain Knowledge Sharing**
Maxwell facilitates knowledge sharing between skills:

```yaml
Example: TCA + SharePlay integration
- skill-maxwell-tca provides @Shared patterns
- skill-maxwell-shareplay provides session patterns
- Maxwell creates integration patterns combining both
- Result: New integrated knowledge domain
```
