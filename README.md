# Maxwell - Framework Expertise & Cross-Domain Integration System

**Maxwell** is a knowledge and expertise system for helping developers and AI agents navigate complex, multi-framework Apple development. Maxwell provides both auto-triggered skills for quick answers and a hybrid knowledge router that coordinates with sosumi for comprehensive coverage.

> **Core Insight**: Maxwell's value is its knowledge content (63 Swift implementation files and extensive framework expertise), not the architecture. The system provides practical patterns and real-world solutions for modern Apple development.

**For the architectural decision and rationale, see [`ARCHITECTURE-DECISION.md`](ARCHITECTURE-DECISION.md)** - especially if you're wondering "why Maxwell instead of upgrading Smith?" or "why not consolidate everything?"

## Architecture Overview

Maxwell follows a **Hybrid Knowledge Routing** architecture that combines multiple expertise sources:

```
maxwell/
├── skills/                   # Specialized expertise modules
│   ├── skill-tca/           # The Composable Architecture expertise
│   ├── skill-shareplay/     # SharePlay & spatial experiences
│   ├── skill-pointfree/     # Point-Free ecosystem integration
│   └── skill-maxwell/       # Core routing & coordination

│   ├── SimpleDatabase.swift # Core SQLite implementation
│   ├── SimpleMigrator.swift # Database migration tools
│   └── Package.swift        # Swift package configuration

├── SharePlay/               # SharePlay-specific resources
├── PointFree/               # Point-Free integration layer
└── _development/            # Implementation guides & research
```

## The Simple Architecture

Maxwell follows a clean **Skill + Subagent** architecture:

1. **Maxwell Skills** (auto-triggered): Quick pattern lookup from SQLite database
2. **Maxwell Subagents** (explicit): Deep expertise with file access and sosumi integration

**Simple Workflow:**
```
Developer Question
    ↓
Auto-trigger: maxwell skill (keywords: @Shared, SharePlay, etc.)
    ↓
Simple question?
  ✅ → Return pattern from Maxwell DB (2 seconds)
  ❌ → Recommend explicit subagent invocation
    ↓
Task("maxwell-tca", ...) or Task("maxwell-shareplay", ...)
    ↓
Subagent analyzes code + Maxwell patterns + sosumi (when needed)
```

**sosumi Integration:**
- **Maxwell skills**: Framework patterns and expertise
- **Maxwell subagents**: Can call sosumi for official Apple documentation
- **Standard agent pattern**: Like any expert agent, Maxwell subagents use sosumi when needed

### Why This Matters

Modern Apple apps are multi-framework:
```
App = TCA state + SharePlay collaboration + RealityKit 3D
      + CloudKit sync + Core Data + SwiftUI/AppKit
```

A developer doesn't ask "How do I use TCA?" but rather:
**"How do I sync RealityKit entities across a TCA-managed SharePlay session?"**

This is a cross-domain question. The unified knowledge layer makes it answerable.

## Development Workflow

Maxwell enables a sophisticated AI development loop:

1. **Main Agent** receives feature request
2. **Delegation** to specialized sub-agent based on domain requirements
3. **Guided Implementation** with patterns and architectural advice
4. **Smith Validation** runs rules from the same module
5. **Violation Reports** identify architectural issues
6. **Iterative Refinement** until validation passes
7. **Integration** of completed feature

## Installation

### Cloud Deployment
Each Maxwell module is designed to be deployed as:

1. **Agent Installation**: Register the specialized agent in your cloud agent registry
2. **Skill Installation**: Add the knowledge base to your skills registry
3. **Validation Rules**: Configure Smith validation with the module's rulesets

### Usage Patterns

#### Skill-Based Access
```bash
# Direct skill invocation
skill: "maxwell-shareplay"  # SharePlay expertise
skill: "maxwell-tca"        # TCA expertise
```

#### Agent Delegation
Main agents can delegate to specialized agents:
```
delegate_to: "maxwell-shareplay"  # For GroupActivities implementation
delegate_to: "maxwell-tca"        # For TCA architecture
```

#### Validation Integration
```bash
# Run Smith validation with module rules
smith validate --rules tca/validation/
smith validate --rules shareplay/validation/
```

## Validation System

Maxwell includes the **Smith Validation** framework for architectural enforcement:

- **Architecture Compliance**: Ensures implementations follow best practices
- **Pattern Validation**: Verifies correct usage of framework patterns
- **Quality Gates**: Acts like unit tests for architectural decisions
- **Violation Reporting**: Detailed feedback on implementation issues
- **Iterative Improvement**: Guides refinement until compliance is achieved
